The code here have no reason to exist except to waste my precious time.

I will try to keep track of everything (just to waste more time).

## bat address book

A address book writen as a windows batch file.(in italian)

A guy on a telegram group shows up with this homework asking for help, 
why help when i can just do it?

It's a useful memento about never use batch files

## php gif

Meta (html tag) is used to "force" continuos refresh of the web page
Cookies are used to store cat's position and direction
Php is used to read(/update) the cookies and (of course) to redraw the page with the cat in the new position.

This idea come up in my mind thanks to a question in the course *Web and multimedia technology*:

In a web page there is the image of a cat moving from left to right et. viceversa; clicking the image of the cat (but not the nearby area) another page is open. 
What of the following technologies can be use to obtain this effect?...

now i can answer "ALL OF THEM"

## mips32 BF

I already did that(it was a JIT actualy), some years ago, as assignment for a course but i can't find it :/

I'll probably improve this in the next future.
